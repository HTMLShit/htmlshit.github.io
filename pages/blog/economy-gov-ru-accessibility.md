White House Accessibility Features
With a new American President comes a great deal of changes. I wasn't expecting new website features starting on day one, though! The website for the US White House was able to launch a feature that focuses on accessibility.

I love that it's right there in the open and doesn't rely on users to change their own phone settings if they need assistance reading the content. I also like the menu button placement for ease of use, but on iOS it requires two taps to open. Still, it's in an easier to reach place than the hamburger menu at the top of most websites.
